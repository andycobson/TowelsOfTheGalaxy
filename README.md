# baby_tracks

The goal of this project is to create an application that tracks and displays in a meaningful manner pertinent tasks/information about one or more babies. We need to implement an easy to use application for the average parent, with minimal navigation to track tasks. Additional features required include detailed analysis of user-created tracking instances and an overview of daily inputs with totals of like-instances.

Our team “Towels of the Galaxy” aims to create an easy to use and accessible Baby Tracking Software that gives any parent of an infant child the ability to keep up with their baby's needs and history in which they can analyze and use to their benefit. We’ve taken careful consideration including conducting studies on other baby trackers as well as conducting interviews with potential users. Each study and interview helped us understand the necessary and quality of life functions of a baby tracker. As a result we were able to pin-point our goals as the following: 

* Smooth and polished use experience
* Easy to understand UI
* Multiple functions each tracked and easily accessible
* Collection and analysis of user created data
* Overview of daily inputs with totals of like-instances

The implementation of our program will be a mobile application to allow for easy access and everyday use.
